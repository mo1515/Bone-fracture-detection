# Bone-fracture-detection
An application of multiple types of models to detect **bone fractures**.

This is the link to the **example data** that was used:

Feel free to test around with it, or use your own data.



The `pipelines.py` file contains all the preprocessing steps needed to transform the data into a usable, **descriptor-based** format.

The `models_notebook.ipynb` contains the **models'** code.

The `no_pipelines_copy.ipynb` notebook is everything combined in a single notebook, prior to the addition of **pipelines** for clarity.
